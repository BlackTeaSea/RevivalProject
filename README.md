# Revival Project

## Revival Mechanism

In a standard hardcore Minecraft world, players who die are no longer able to respawn, making survival a true challenge. However, with our plugin, teammates have the chance to bring back fallen comrades by undertaking a special challenge.
Crafting the Totem of Revival

To craft the Totem of Revival, teammates must gather the following items:

* 4 Netherite Scraps
* 2 Rotten Flesh
* 1 Eye of Ender
* 1 Totem of Undying
* 1 Blaze Powder

Combine these items in a crafting table to create the Totem of Revival.
Performing the Revival Ritual

1. Craft the Totem of Revival: Use the crafting table to combine the gathered items into the Totem of Revival.
2. Choose a Body of Water: Find a body of water in your Minecraft world.
3. Activate the Ritual: Throw the Totem of Revival into the water. This will trigger the revival process.
4. Select the Player to Revive: A prompt will appear, allowing you to choose which fallen teammate you wish to bring back to life.
5. Witness the Resurrection: The selected player will be resurrected and respawn in the game.

By following these steps, you can bring your teammates back into the game, adding an exciting and strategic element to your Minecraft Hardcore experience.
